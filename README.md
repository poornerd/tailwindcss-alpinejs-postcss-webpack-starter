## Why a starter project?

A starter project is a great way to jumpstart your development process and get up and running quickly with modern web technologies. This starter project includes all the necessary configuration files and dependencies to start building web applications with Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Webpack. You can use this starter project as a starting point for your own web projects, or as a learning resource to understand how to set up and configure these technologies.

## Why Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Webpack?

Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable CSS framework that allows you to easily build complex user interfaces without writing custom CSS. Tailwind CSS provides a wide range of pre-designed styles and utilities that you can use to quickly build responsive and accessible user interfaces. PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins, which allows you to write modern CSS syntax and take advantage of new CSS features while ensuring cross-browser compatibility. Webpack is a powerful module bundler that allows you to easily manage your project dependencies, build your project for production, and run a development server to test your application locally.

## Getting started
